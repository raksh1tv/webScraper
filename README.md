# webScraper
full-stack application that scrapes content from a user-provided website URL. The application should allow users to interact with a chatbot that uses the scraped content to generate responses, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM techniques.

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to:
âœ” Scrape website content (only from the provided URL) and store it for future retrieval.
âœ” Chat with an AI-powered chatbot using the Groq API.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Efficient Web Scraping: Extracts only the text from the given page (ignores external links).
âœ… Caching System: Stores scraped content in an SQLite database to prevent redundant requests.
âœ… AI Chatbot: Uses Groq's API to generate intelligent responses.
âœ… Secure API Key Handling: Uses .env file to store sensitive API keys.
âœ… Fast and Lightweight: Built with Flask, BeautifulSoup, and SQLite.
